# CPP11-Examples
Collection of C++11 feature examples

In order to use C++11 you will need at least:
 * g++ 4.7
 * clang++ 3.3
 * visual studio 2013

All three have been adding features incrementally,
so some advanced features may not be available until later releases.

These examples are by no means exhaustive. Some big omitted features:
 * Regex
 * Concurrency
 * constexpr
 * Variadic templates
 * decltype
 * a whole lot more STL stuff
