# CPP11-Examples
Collection of C++11 feature examples

In order to use C++11 you will need at least:
 * g++ 4.7
 * clang++ 3.3
 * visual studio 2013

All three have been adding features incrementally,
so some advanced features may not be available until later releases.
To enable C++11 features, you have to include either the original
-std=c++0x or the new -std=c++11 flag to your compile statement.

These examples are by no means exhaustive. Some big omitted features:
 * Concurrency
 * Regex
 * constexpr
 * Variadic templates
 * decltype
 * a whole lot more STL stuff

For more complete listing of features, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11).
